This is a repository for 3D models made with open source software (like FreeCAD). Some of the models will be generated by hand and others programmatically using scripts.

So far I have included:
- [Chess pieces](https://github.com/nicoguaro/3D_models/tree/master/chess)
- [Cup holder](https://github.com/nicoguaro/3D_models/tree/master/cup_holder)
- [Mana item](https://github.com/nicoguaro/3D_models/tree/master/mana_item)
